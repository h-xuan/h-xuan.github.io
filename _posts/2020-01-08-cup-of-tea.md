<h3>On interests, hobbies & favourite things</h3>

Growing up, I've always found myself drawn towards a variety of things, with nothing standing out in particular. I liked dipping my toes into anything that caught my fancy: music, languages, the arts...without ever becoming exceptional in any of them. Devoting all my attention to one interest for a prolonged period of time usually leaves me restless - I'd have a nagging fear of losing my touch in all the other subjects. Ironically, that only resulted in an intense feeling of overwhelm; getting good at each and every single thing I was interested in would probably take me 10 lifetimes!

In addition, obediently adhering to the rules and regulations of an institutionalized education system for the most part of my life has unknowingly installed a filter in my subconscious that evaluates the value of everything I do based on how 'useful' it will be for my future. And things like music and art didn't rank very high on the list of Things You Should Do to Secure A High-Paying Job, which had been a source of internal conflict for quite some time.

I have since learnt to adopt a realistic approach to life. I can't say that I have even a fraction of life figured out, but what I do believe is that reality is relative. And that means we get to decide how things fit within our framework of reality, built upon the foundation of our personal core values. There's no harm in listening to advice from well-intentioned peers or parents who only want the best for us, but at the end of the day we are all individuals with a unique set of things that make us tick and things that rub us the wrong way, and there should be a limit to how much we choose to compromise our souls to fit into the roles expected of us. For me, reality is doing what makes me feel alive. It is cherishing the time spent with loved ones, immersing myself in a good book, working up a sweat after a workout, aimlessly wandering around the city with no destination in mind just to soak in the sights and sounds of this beautiful garden city. It is indulging in all of my interests and hobbies, which add so much more colour and flavour to my life and fuel me with the motivation to truly live instead of surrendering to the flow of the conventional lifestyle. Not that the conventional lifestyle is always undesirable; it may very well be the dream life for people who value stability and comfort, but I feel my soul die a little every time I am made to entrust the sovereignty over my own life to anybody else. I value fair and respectful cooperation and I love collaborating with people, and all I ask for is the freedom to be myself.

Anyway, I hope I'm not digressing too much - just thought I'd share a little on how my view on interests evolved over time from that of a badge of my employability to an indispensable part of life. Today, I wanna elaborate more on the three main focuses of this blog, why I love them and what I hope to achieve for each area.

<h3>Web development</h3>
I got acquainted with the internet rather early in my life; before I knew it, I was spending days and nights creating Neopets Petpages (if this rings a bell with you, we probably share a pretty similar childhood), messing around with HTML templates without any actual understanding of the code, and being deeply inspired by the breathtaking layouts of some personal websites in the 2000s (most of which now reside in the internet graveyard, sadly). The web has been, and still is, my window to the world. It's where I teach myself new skills, satiate my curiosity, and discover so many passionate and inspiring people who would become my role models. The internet is astoundingly powerful, and I hope to work with it as a medium to help people, spread love & joy, and to satisfy my craving for problem-solving and designing.

My current focus would be on front-end development, with the aim of venturing into full-stack & webapp development. Due to the lack of a comprehensive course on web development at my university, I will be self-learning many of the skills and practicing them through personal projects.

<h3>Illustration & design</h3>
Drawing was another big part of my childhood. Before computers first appeared in my home, I mainly occupied my time by drawing. From imaginary cities to family portraits, I drew anything my 7-year-old brain could conceive of. And as embarrassing as it sounds, my dream occupation as a kid was to be an artist. It was a short-lived dream though, soon to be replaced with the shinier, fancier title of a Web Designer, but from time to time the desire to pick up the pencil would creep up on me and I would once again be reminded of how happy drawing makes me feel. And now, I've decided to finally pay it some serious attention. Instead of traditional pencil drawing, I'll be working on digital illustration, which I feel is a much more flexible medium on top of saving resources, and my goal is to make inspiring art, and also for pure, unbridled self-satisfaction.

The definition of design can be rather broad, and I've chosen not to narrow it down to any specific branch of design although the overarching theme would be visual design. I'm interested in learning the general principles and techniques of design which can be applied across the board in order to create things that more people can rejoice with.

<h3>Japanese</h3>
This one's a strange one and I could never provide a satisfactory answer whenever I'm asked why I study Japanese. Initially, I was only intending to dabble in it for a bit, without expecting I'd fall so deep. Would it have been fine if it were any other language? Perhaps, but I'd have to argue that Japanese is probably the most aesthetically pleasing language I've ever laid my eyes upon and coming across anything in Japanese never fails to put a twinkle in my eyes. It's the one thing that's thoroughly convinced me that we don't need a reason for why we love what we do.

Honestly, after close to 4 years of self-studying I'm still nowhere near fluent, but that's also where the fun lies: discovering the meanings of new words, stumbling my way through a conversation, realising I've been using some words incorrectly all this while. And I'm in no hurry, since there's no destination; I only seek to savour every moment of the journey.

<hr>
In this day and age where pursuing success or materialistic wealth seems to have become our duty as members of a modern capitalist society, it's easy to be desensitized to our own preferences from the voices telling us what we should love and do with our lives. We sometimes disregard the tinge of excitement and yearning in our hearts we hold for hobbies that we've deemed useless, and delude ourselves into believing we really care about other things just so we can give our resumes an edge over the rest. I think it's sad to extinguish our own flame and settle for a somewhat tolerable existence when we could be so much more.

I'm still a lost and confused human being as I have always been, but I've learnt to embrace the uncertainty and accept that it's okay to not have everything figured out. I'll take one baby step at a time, striving to never lose sight of the tinders to my inner fire, the reasons I peel myself off the bed every morning, and my gratitude for being blessed with the precious gift of life.

*The first draft didn't turn out the way I envisioned it to be so I had to redo it but I guess there were a few takeaways. I experimented with textures, looked into colour theory (I feel the colours were a total flop in this one though...), and found that I quite like the blobby, flat style as compared to smooth gradients.*
