<h3>🧾 progress report</h3>

<p>
💻: I'm officially done with Odin's foundations track with the calculator app so I thought I'd take a look through their Javascript path to brace myself for what's about to come, and oh boy have I barely scratched the surface of the depths of web development. I estimate it's gonna take me at least a month or two even if I cranked up the pace but I'm really looking forward to being able to build all sorts of exciting stuff.
</p>
<br>
<p>
🎨: I'm almost nearing the end of the Inktober challenge (with the first half of the challenge casually left out) and it's been a rewarding journey in terms of building discipline and trying out different styles/perspectives. I'm contemplating the direction of my Instagram account after Inktober; I may use my daily Japanese studies as inspiration for my art, like crafting a story out of new words/phrases I learn everyday or something. Who knows? I'll think about this a little more.
</p>
<br>
<p>
💬: I've only been logging hours spent on input (mainly reading) but I spend a considerable amount of time looking up phrases to write my captions as well. Allotting blocks of time to Japanese specifically also gave me the patience to work through my Anki flashcards without boring myself three minutes in.

</p>

<br>
<h3>💭 reflections</h3>
<p>A pretty productive week in my book, given how I've been operating on less than optimal sleep for the entire week. The pomodoro technique is a wonder - I've come across it all the time in productivity/self-improvement articles but I didn't expect it to be so effective in overcoming the inertia of starting things. All it took was one click of a button to switch my brain into work mode. Amazing. I'm still far from becoming a productivity master though, as you can probably tell from my incomplete todo lists, but it's a good start.
</p>

<p>
I think it's time to set my priorities straight. Art and japanese have been occupying most of my attention, and while I enjoyed every single moment spent working on them, I feel that webdev is gradually being squeezed out of the picture. The grand plan was to dedicate my mornings, when my brain is the freshest, to the most mentally demanding tasks, and leave the mind-numbing ones for when my energy dips after lunch, but my mornings have been pretty much nonexistent this week. My brain isn't letting me sleep. 😪
</p>
<p>
I'm also going to look for freelance work/part time jobs soon to sustain myself financially while I work through the curriculum. There's just one tiny issue - the pimple on my eye is, quite literally, an eyesore, and I'm postponing my job search till it heals. 
</p>

<br>
<h3>🚀 action plan</h3>

<p>Sleep...!</p>
<p>
I may also try to be more flexible with my schedule; apart from the daily non-negotiables (workout, drawing), I might allocate larger chunks of time at one go for each subject instead. I'm gonna decide just one thing to focus on each day to minimize distractions and to better utilize the flow state.
