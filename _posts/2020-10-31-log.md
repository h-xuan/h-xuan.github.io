<p>1:38 (yes midnight): Writing reflections for my 1-month Insta journey took way longer than I'd planned and my drawing turned out pretty unsatisfactory BUT it's ok unforeseen circumstances happen and we just gotta roll with it.</p>

<p>22:45: Is this the first time I completely clear my todo list??? It's been a great day although I spent a large chunk of it racking my brains over what to write for today's caption. </p>

<p>23:38: Didn't get to write my weekly reflections after going on a little not-so-fruitful adventure today. Pushing it till tomorrow!</p>

<h3>🧾 progress report</h3>

<p>
💻: On track to completing another project, which is honestly kinda similar to the todo list one that I've done previously but this one covered more concepts on object-oriented programming. I was hoping to spruce up the design by creating custom vector icons but judging from how I struggled making a decent heart, it's probably gonna take me some time. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
🎨: Same old same old. With the end of Inktober, my new plan is to base my drawing on a sentence crafted with new Japanese vocabulary/phrases I learnt during the day, and so far it's been great. Recently I feel like my abilities are stagnating and my compositions are growing similar, so I might do a combination of drawing with reference (for study purposes) and adding birds/objects/whatever I see fit. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
💬: Frankly, I'm beginning to question my own motives and motivation for studying Japanese. Maybe I just haven't found a way to put my knowledge to good use. Or I just need to start making friends and having conversations again. I mean, books and media are fine and all but it does get a little lonely sometimes.

</p>

<h3>💭 reflections</h3>

<p>
Instagram has definitely been taking up far too much mental real estate than I'd prefer, and a lot of times it's just me being stuck in my own head and worrying if my art looks decent or if my caption makes sense. Time to snap out of it - it's meant to be a LOG, not a professional portfolio where each and every piece has to be a masterpiece. My focus should be on improving my art/language abilities everyday, and any positive reception would be the icing on the cake.

</p>
<p>
Another thing - social media, as the name suggests, should be an online platform for socializing but I find that I'm not experiencing the social aspects much beyond the superficial level. (Perhaps the problem lies in my unrealistic expectations.) I've come across a few profiles that felt like friend material but I'm absolutely clueless as to how to initiate conversations without sounding like a creep. Maybe Instagram just isn't the right place for making friends (or I'm just doing it wrong).

</p>

<p>
On a brighter note, I've been sleeping and waking up earlier and my mornings feel productive again. I'd have to carefully divide my day into working and chilling modes to prevent distractions from running my days...
</p>

<br>
<h3>🚀 action plan</h3>
<p>I just realised I haven't updated the curriculum for November but I doubt I have any changes to make so I'll be sticking to it for this month too. Have a great, fulfilling, productive (or not) week ahead! 🌈
