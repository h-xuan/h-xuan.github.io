<h3>Skeletons out the closet</h3>

I have a deep-rooted fear of being seen. <br>
Of speaking, because I can never put my thoughts perfectly into words and so I get nervous and speak too fast and trip over my words and make a spectacular mess of the speech I'd rehearsed at least 30 times in my head.
Of not sounding intelligent enough or looking good enough or being skilful enough or socializing enough or doing enough.

I'm too accustomed to being an onlooker of my own life, watching myself succumb to my fears and shame, withdrawing time and again back into my comfort zone to protect my fragile ego. Yet this act is nothing more than a highly destructive form of self-sabotage - it does not protect. Instead, it temporarily distracts me from the fear of uncertainty, weakens my resolve and instils limiting beliefs which only serve to perpetuate the vicious cycle. It forces me back into the cave, to watch shadows on the wall in awe, failing to realise that the outside world is a billion times more magical, beautiful, and extraordinary. If fear stems mainly from unfamiliarity, then every courageous leap into the unknown is the very exposure and practice we need to move from a place of fear to that of love, acceptance, and confidence.

And it's time for me to stop waiting for the moment when I'm ready, because truth is 98% of the time I'll never be ready. Besides, isn't it exhilarating to take action despite the vigorously pounding heart and excessively sweaty palms only to find out that things are not nearly as bad as I'd anticipated? I am enough, the way I am. Enough doesn't mean resting on my laurels and not striving to be better; enough means accepting that I am so terribly flawed but also so terribly human, and that I am worthy of life. We are all worthy of life. All we have to do is believe it wholeheartedly.

With that said, time to go out there and make a complete fool of myself. ðŸ¤ª
