<h3>FESTIVE SEASON IS HERE</h3>

Hello! It's been a while since I posted anything. Regrettably, daily updates didn't happen, but it's been two wholesome weeks with plenty of socializing, recharging, and forcing myself out of my comfort zone (and surviving!). School has begun, which means it's pretty much impossible to update as frequently as I'd like to, but I'll still aim to keep this place alive with random life updates and maybe an illustration or two.

Chinese new year has been a whirlwind of mind games and house-hopping and trying to find a corner with enough space to breathe. I've come to the conclusion that I'm absolutely hopeless at bluffing; more than once I've been too engrossed in my good guy act that I'd essentially led my opponents to victory. It's admirable to watch some people outright lie without batting an eyelid though, I aspire to be that eloquent and charismatic one day. I'm definitely very blessed to have such a wonderful family and relatives who have been so accepting and supportive of me despite my quirks - my dietary restrictions, disastrous fashion sense (will work on it), pseudo-speech impediment...what did I do to deserve such goodness?

<h3>HAIR SALON MISADVENTURES & MORE</h3>

Shortly after my previous post, I really did went out and successfully made a fool of myself, starting with a phone call. Honestly, the phone call was the hardest part. I'd wanted to book an appointment at a Japanese hair salon and for some very good reason decided I would do the call in Japanese. That decision itself made me hesitate for 3 hours pacing around my room waiting for the courage to press the call button. Then, taking one final deep breath, I touched the screen.

Long story short, I had failed in the worst possible way. The worst-case scenario I had in mind literally unfolded in front of my eyes, but right after the call I was unleashed. The fear and shame that's rendered me immobile evaporated completely; it was an incredibly liberating feeling. Which lasted probably around 30 minutes, but the residual courage from this incident allowed me to do things I'd never imagine being able to do: initiating a conversation in the midst of dead silence. Sending the first message. Making the first call.

Human interactions are, ironically, so tiring yet so fulfilling. I've learnt that for me, it's about striking a good balance between socializing and leaving sufficient time for introspection and self-reflection. Too much social time leaves me extremely drained and cranky and pulls me further away from being my best self. On the other hand, too much alone time isolates me and sends me on a downward spiral into negativity and depression. As much as I'd like to believe I can be totally happy on my own, no man is an island, and disconnecting myself from the outside world means giving up the very element that makes life fascinating, meaningful, and worthwhile. And while not all relationships are positive, they are all valuable in teaching us lessons in love, acceptance, and gratitude.

If you come across people who care about you enough to give you the time of day, hold them very, very close to your heart.

<h3>SCHOOL</h3>
Unfortunately, school has begun yet again, and from the past two day's worth of lectures I can sense it's gonna be a heck of a ride this time. UI/UX is the module I'm looking forward to the most, although the lecture today really doesn't feel very promising. I can foresee that the courseload this term would far exceed that of last term (cries internally throughout entire deep learning lecture) but I feel ready for a challenge. Some intense self-discipline and time management skills are probably necessary to get the schoolwork out of the way ASAP to make time for more important things in life, and let's hope I emerge from this term alive.

Also experimented with drawing human bodies - tried to reference a 3D model but it didn't turn out as cute. Went for a completely flat design (even the gradient in the background, which doesn't look too bad if I say so myself).</span>
