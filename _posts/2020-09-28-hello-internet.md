Thanks for stumbling upon my little virtual space. Read on if you're curious about what a random stranger on the internet is up to in her post-graduation life.

<h3>ðŸ¤” what's all this for? </h3>
<p>I think too much and do too little. Hence, I built this site for three main purposes:</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Accountability.</b> Throughout all my formal education years, I've been a chronic procrastinator who'd put in just enough effort to make sure I stayed out of trouble. Ironically, I am most productive when I procrastinate - in language learning, reading, anything but the things that needed to be done. I've managed to develop a reasonably decent work ethic in the past year or so, although it's still nowhere near the level of self-discipline needed to bring my project ideas to fruition. Therefore, having to track my progress regularly keeps me accountable and ensures I'm not squandering my precious NEET time on things that ultimately do not matter.</li>

    <br>

    <li><b>Putting myself out there.</b> Having struggled with crippling shyness while growing up, it's a daunting task to write so openly about my thoughts and feelings. I feel so vulnerable revealing my fears and weaknesses and other possibly incriminating material that could jeopardize my future career/potential relationships, but I've hidden myself away from the world for way too long. I want to be unfraid to express my truest, most authentic self, to acknowledge my imperfections and work towards becoming a kinder, better, and more loving human being. How else can we forge genuine connections without baring our souls and accepting each other for who we really are? Earnest, unabashedly genuine people never fail to leave me in awe, and I aspire to be one someday. That's why I'm gonna learn to share freely and openly, to discover my own voice, and to take a big, courageous step outside my comfort zone into the vast yet incredibly exciting unknown.

    </li>
    <br>
    <li><b>Motivation.</b> I'm not a fan of relying on motivation to get things started, but on some days the inertia is simply too massive and the gravity of the bed too strong. That's when I can look back at all these things I've managed to accomplish to get the little spark I need to push forward. And if you happen to be feeling deflated and totally unmotivated, hopefully this log can serve as a little encouragement to trudge on towards the direction of your goals and dreams. We're in this together. ðŸ’ª

    </li>

</ul>

<h3>ðŸ“š my personal curriculum: month of september</h3>
<p>It's early September right now and this shall be a month where I go back to basics. I'm not a stickler when it comes to elaborate plans, but knowing myself, I'll probably continue drifting aimlessly if there are no concrete plans to keep me in check. Thus, I've outlined some tasks for each category to be completed on a daily/weekly basis:
</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>ðŸ’» web dev</b></li>
    <li>ãƒ»Resources: <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/home" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a> + <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg" target="_blank">NetNinja (Youtube)</a></li>
    <li>ãƒ»Todos: one mockup every day.</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>ðŸŽ¨ art</b></li>
    <li>ãƒ»Resources: <a href="https://www.ctrlpaint.com/" target="_blank">Ctrl+Paint</a> + some library books on the fundamentals of drawing</li>
    <li>ãƒ»Todos: one drawing/day (either reference/drawing from life).</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>ðŸ’¬ language</b></li>
    <li>ãƒ»Resources: <a href="https://talktomeinkorean.com/" target="_blank">TTMIK</a> (korean) + the internet</li>
    <li>ãƒ»Todos: Insta picture dictionary. Illustrated Korean vocab, captions in Japanese. Three birds with one stone (metaphorically! Birds are my favourite creatures and don't you dare hurt one).</li>
    <br>
    <li><b>ðŸŒˆ an ideal day (rough time blocks)</b></li>
    <li>0800: rise and shine</li>
    <li>0830~1200: web dev time</li>
    <li>1300~1730: art time</li>
    <li>1800~1930: workout, shower</li>
    <li>1930~2200: dinner, language learning time</li>
    <li>2200~2330: BOOK TIME</li>
    <li>2330: zzz...</li>

</ul>
<br>
<p>I'm aware that I have a tendency spread myself too thin, but this time round, I fancy a good challenge. And not having enough time is no longer a valid excuse. I can foresee days where I go completely off-track but I'll do my bestest to keep them to a minimum. Also, I haven't accounted for events that require me leaving the house, but those should be pretty infrequent anyways.</p>

<hr>
<p>That wraps up the purpose for this site's existence and the intense but exhilarating journey I'm about to embark on. Thanks for reading and let the first week begin!</p>
