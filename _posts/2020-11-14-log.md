9:45: Pardon my disappearance for the past two days. I was battling my perpetual existential crisis. Some days I win, some days I don't. Journaling definitely helped put everything back in perspective and I'm feeling a new wave of energy after re-evaluating my life. Let's do our best today~

<h3>ðŸ§¾ progress report</h3>

<p>
ðŸ’»: I've been devoting more hours to web dev and the sheer amount of concepts to learn is a little overwhelming sometimes. Completed the bookshelf project, which shouldn't have even taken me more than a week. Perhaps I should start treating my studies as a 9 to 5 and ramp up the intensity; it feels like I'd never get anywhere otherwise. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
ðŸŽ¨: I can feel my style gradually evolving - I'm less hung up on the accuracy of shapes/colours and simply drawing how I want to. I don't always love the end product but there's always something to be learnt from each piece of work. Honestly, I can barely claim to be studying art with my approach of practising every day and figuring things out through trial-and-error, but then again I'm not shooting for a career as an illustrator and I quite enjoy the pace I'm going at.
</p>
<br>
<p>
ðŸ’¬: It's high time to establish clear goals with this one. It's been nothing more than a hobby yet it has taken up a substantial amount of my free time (though I probably could have gotten further in a shorter time had I been less haphazard in my studies). But I also love it too much to relegate it to a background process...

</p>

<br>
<h3>ðŸ’­ reflections</h3>
<p>
I'm going to shift my focus to web dev until the end of the year at least. Trying to divide my attention between 3 contrasting subjects is probably doing me more harm than good. What I need to do is to be more diligent in my morning studies so that the lack of progress isn't gnawing at the back of my mind throughout the day.

</p>

<br>
<h3>ðŸš€ action plan</h3>
<p>
Made slight adjustments to the daily schedule. Wake up earlier! (Still waking up at around 9-ish) Which means I need to sleep earlier...which means less social media/internet surfing time. And on a completely unrelated note, read more nonfiction books.
