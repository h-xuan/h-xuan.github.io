<h3>Hello and welcome to my blog!</h3>
 This shall be my outlet for self-expression and a place to track my progress in the area of self-development. A disclaimer: my writings can sometimes be obnoxiously idealistic and very, very personal, which is also precisely what I hope to achieve through this blog: to be unafraid of revealing my honest thoughts and feelings and to always be in touch with what makes me human.

<h3>A challenge to myself</h3>
Perfectionism, procrastination and a crippling shyness have plagued me for the most part of my life. The fear of making mistakes often paralyzes me into inaction: I hesitate when putting my pen to a fresh sheet of a notebook for fear of ruining its perfection with anything less than my best; Picking words to express myself takes forever because who knows, there might be words that are more apt or a sentence structure that is more beautiful. This undoubtedly contributed to my tendency to procrastinate, and adding shyness to my list of issues completes the perfect recipe for disaster - I grew more and more passive day by day, avoiding anything that involves putting my creativity to use. I read a fair amount but barely spent any time and effort taking notes, writing reflections and properly assimilating the knowledge and wisdom from the books. Immersing myself in Youtube videos centered around personal development gave me surges of motivation which dissipated almost as immediately, leaving me with the false illusion of productivity. (Note: There are Youtubers who do deliver great value through their videos; I just wasn't in the right mindset to absorb their advice and strategies. I may share my list of some of my favourite bloggers/Youtubers one day.)

Over the past year however, I've began to actively step out of my comfort zone more, to take a shot at things that would normally scare the living daylights out of me:

- I did a 'social experiment' where I forced myself to go out with my lovely friends almost every day for a week, no matter how much my homebody self tried to convince me to stay in with my books and coffee. Together with that I created an Instagram account posting captions describing how each day went, accompanied with a digital drawing depicting activities that I did that day. While my social battery was pretty much drained at the end of the experiment, I've come to realise the preciousness of genuine human interactions, the satisfaction and joy that comes from creating something with my own hands, and that Instagram probably isn't for me after all.
- I had casually set a goal to improve my Japanese speaking skills within the year and surprised myself when I actually mustered up the courage to book a lesson with an online Japanese tutor. Needless to say, I was really nervous and could hardly string a proper sentence together but the experience gave me immense confidence and taught me that my fears are irrational most of the time. What's important isn't how flawlessly I can speak, but how willing and eager I am to learn and to improve.
- I did a summer internship as a curriculum developer at a company offering tech courses for kids and one of the requirements was to teach a couple of classes ourselves. Despite the small 1:6 instructor-student ratio per class, handling a class of six 9-year-olds undergoing their very first rebellious phase was still a psychologically damaging challenge for me. Not to mention, having to present in front of all their parents at the end of the class was just the icing on the cake. Nevertheless, this internship has played a big role in helping me overcome my shyness and improving my communication skills (which definitely still needs work).

My struggles may perhaps seem puzzling to some; going out with friends or speaking in small groups may be natural everyday occurrences that do not call for much thought, but I consider them to be little breakthroughs in my life and I can say I'm proud of how far I've come. I'm excited to do and create more, to continue pushing my limits, to forge valuable human connections, and to witness all the beauty that life has to offer.

<h3>Clarity of thought</h3>
Organizing my thoughts in a clear, linear fashion is also something I've struggled with for a long time. My train of thoughts tend to run in 10 different directions simultaneously and it's difficult for me to verbally explain anything requiring more than 3 lines in a remotely cohesive manner. Hence, through regular blogging I hope to practice translating my thoughts into words more smoothly and effectively.

<h3>Accountability & self-discipline</h3>
Apart from documenting my random ramblings, another reason for starting this blog is to record my progress in the fields of (mainly): web development, design & illustration, and occasionally, Japanese. I may be biting off more than I can chew here but I intend to work on these 3 subjects concurrently by incorporating my own designs/illustrations into my blog posts and personal webdev projects. I may also translate snippets of my posts into Japanese, and sprinkle my designs with Japanese because the language just looks so beautiful.

As much as possible, I hope to be able to write a post everyday but judging from the amount of time I'm taking to write this one it may be slightly overly ambitious of me. I'll still aim to crank out posts as often as I can anyway as a way of keeping myself accountable and preventing myself from slipping back into a rut, especially while I'm still on my winter break.

With this, I hope that this blog would be helpful in some form or another for anyone who finds my experiences/interests relateable. I still have a long, long way to go, and I'll be glad if you decide to join me in my journey to become a more driven, creative, and kinder human. Thanks for reading my little monologue and I hope to see you around!
