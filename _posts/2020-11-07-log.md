<p>0:39: Didn't complete what I set out to do today but ended up binging on a painting tutorial series and I learnt so much within an hour! Tried applying what I've learnt while doing my piece today and failed tragically as my colours turned out horribly messed up as usual and my composition was rather cluttered with something to focus on in every corner. But I'm excited to see what more I can do with my shiny new knowledge in the future.

<h3>🧾 progress report</h3>

<p>
💻: Progress has been slow but I'm having a good time working on the design. I'm a few features away from publishing and I should probably wrap this up real soon so that I can move on to more exciting things. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
🎨: My Adobe student license has finally expired so I've moved onto Krita, and it's been an amazing experience so far! It takes some getting used to but I love the wide range of brushes and the lightweightedness as compared to Photoshop. I also stumbled upon an art fundamentals <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLmXZMqb_9sbNLM83NrM005vRQHw1yTKn" target="_blank">series</a> while searching for tutorials and that was hands down the best tutorial series I've ever come across - it succinctly summarizes concepts in a very digestible manner, accompanied by demonstrations and a wicked sense of humour, in a mere hour (on 1.5x speed of course🙃). Anyway, my drawing themes have been rather haphazard but I've begun stringing together a story with my drawings and I think I could keep this up for a while. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
💬: I need to practice my speaking! I've been so out of touch that I couldn't muster the courage to speak in Japanese to my Japanese hairdresser😖 In my defense, I was waiting for a good timing to initiate a conversation but that never came, as it had been either eerily silent or a cacophony of hairdryer/shower noises. Not to mention the awkwardness of speaking with masks on combined with my bad hearing. Anyway...time to look for online tutors. (How many times have I been saying this?)

<h3>💭 reflections</h3>
<p>
Just when I thought my weeks are becoming repetitive, I found study-with-me livestreams on youtube that are live for the whole day every day of the week. And now I don't feel so strange. I find their resolution and discipline highly admirable and I wish I was less afraid to admit I spend all my days 'studying'.  
</p>
<p>
I have a series of hangout sessions planned for the following week (somehow they all coincidentally fall on the same week) and I feel a little ready to be social. Although I think the number of common topics are dwindling by the day as my friends transition to the working phase of life. It'll be nice to find people who are on the same journey as I am.
</p>

<br>
<h3>🚀 action plan</h3>
<p>
Finish up the library project. Be more consistent with my podomoros. Learn from study-with-me guy. Reach out to people more. Be more confident in myself.
