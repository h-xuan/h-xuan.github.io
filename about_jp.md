<h3>💖 my values</h3>
I keep and regularly revise a short list of around 10 values that resonate the most strongly with me, and I strive to make decisions in accordance with these values. Here's the list ordered somewhat according to importance:
<ul>
<li><b>Love</b>: referring to love in a general, all-encompassing sense - love for ourselves and others, for what we do, for the environment and the planet, for all living beings, for life itself. </li>
<li><b>Kindness</b>: to treat others and ourselves with care and compassion.</li>
<li><b>Authenticity</b>: to live in congruence with my values and beliefs. </li>
<li><b>Curiosity</b>: to be curious about the world around me, how things work, why things are the way they are. To never stop questioning.</li>
<li><b>Creativity</b>: to imagine, ideate, and make things that reflect our wonderful idiosyncrasies.</li>
<li><b>Freedom</b>: to have the ability to pursue what I want in life.</li>
<li><b>Consistency</b>: to have the discipline to maintain a happy and productive state over the long term.</li>
<li><b>Courage</b>: to be brave in the face of fear.</li>
<li><b>Peace</b>: to maintain inner calm in the midst of chaos.</li>
<li><b>Health</b>: to appreciate my physical and mental wellbeing and to celebrate what my body and mind can accomplish.</li>
</ul>
<h3>💡 interests</h3>
<p>I have a broad range of interests, but I am most passionate when creating things (art, writing, programming, the list goes on...) and learning languages. Other activities I enjoy on my free time include: reading, listening to music, singing, photography, watching neighbourhood birds do their thing, messing around on my digital piano, cooking, reading blogs, drinking coffee. </p>
<p>Learning new things fuels my soul and allows me to see the bigger picture and to draw connections between seemingly unrelated concepts. My thirst for knowledge knows no bounds - from natural sciences to the arts and humanities, from philosophy to botany - collecting nuggets of knowledge can be incredibly exciting.</p>

<h3>🌱 why veganism?</h3>
<p>I consider myself a huge lover of animals, although it still surprises me how I'd lived 20 odd years without questioning the idea of eating the flesh of the very animals I claimed to love. In September 2019, I converted to veganism overnight after watching Earthlings, a documentary which exposes the horrors of the meat, dairy and egg industries. It was a much-needed awakening to the reality that I was directly sentencing innocent sentient beings to their deaths simply by being an ignorant consumer. (I am by no means implying that all meat eaters are ignorant; rather, I am disappointed in how oblivious I was to the extent of suffering I was causing through the seemingly innocuous act of buying and consuming meat.) In addition, learning about the negative environmental impacts resulting from livestock agriculture further reinforced my belief in veganism.</p>
<p>After going vegan, it felt as though a heavy load was lifted off my shoulders. My subconscious probably had an inkling that something was amiss all along, and making the switch helped sort out the inconsistencies I didn't know I had regarding my views on animals and food. More importantly, it has taught me to live more consciously; to be more in tune with my own emotions, more aware of the repercussions of my actions, and more proactive in steering my life towards a more meaningful existence.</p>
<p>To me, choosing not to partake in the exploitation of animals and the destruction of the environment is a commitment to show love and kindness towards animals, the planet, and myself.</p>

<p>If you've made it all the way down, I must say I'm very touched. Thank you for sharing the past few minutes of your time with me, and I'd love to hear from you too.</p>
