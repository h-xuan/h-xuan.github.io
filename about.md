Thank you for dropping by my humble little corner of the world wide web.

<h2>üíª about this site</h2>
This is a space where I document my messy attempts to juggle my multitude of interests and hobbies. It is a journal I carry with me on my journey of exploration and discovery, both of the beautiful, extraordinary world we inhabit, and of the values and beliefs that shape my core and guide me in the direction towards a fulfilling life.

Some of the subjects I'm actively working on currently are: web development, design & illustration, and the Japanese language. This blog serves as a means of integrating these interests into my everyday life, and also as an avenue to share my personal journey of self-growth with my fellow human beings in hopes of reminding each other to never forget the magic of life.

<h2>üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è about me</h2>
Hi! I'm xuan.

An aspiring creator, a life enthusiast, a curious hermit.<br>
Also a computer science undergraduate, a Singaporean born and bred, a self-learner and a hopeful dreamer.

Self-introductions have always been a struggle for me. Despite all the labels, it's virtually impossible to pinpoint something so fluid, ever-changing, and multidimensional as that of a human personality. I hope to forever be a work in progress, constantly evolving through an iterative cycle of discovering my values and re-examining my beliefs, and then as far as possible living by these values consciously and mindfully.

<h3>üíñ my values</h3>
I keep and regularly revise a short list of around 10 values that resonate the most strongly with me, and I strive to make decisions in accordance with these values. Here's the list somewhat in order of priority:
<ul>
<li><b>Love</b>: referring to love in a general, all-encompassing sense - love for ourselves and others, for what we do, for the environment and the planet, for all living beings, for life itself. </li>
<li><b>Kindness</b>: to treat others and ourselves with care and compassion.</li>
<li><b>Authenticity</b>: to live in congruence with my values and beliefs. </li>
<li><b>Curiosity</b>: to be curious about the world around me, how things work, why things are the way they are. To never stop questioning.</li>
<li><b>Creativity</b>: to imagine, ideate, and make things that reflect our wonderful idiosyncrasies.</li>
<li><b>Freedom</b>: to have the ability to pursue what I want in life.</li>
<li><b>Consistency</b>: to have the discipline to maintain a happy and productive state over the long term.</li>
<li><b>Courage</b>: to be brave in the face of fear.</li>
<li><b>Peace</b>: to maintain inner calm in the midst of chaos.</li>
<li><b>Health</b>: to appreciate my physical and mental wellbeing and to celebrate what my body and mind can accomplish.</li>
</ul>
<h3>üí° interests</h3>
<p>I have a broad range of interests, but I am most passionate when creating things (art, writing, programming, the list goes on...) and learning languages. Other activities I enjoy on my free time include: reading, listening to music, singing, photography, watching neighbourhood birds do their thing, messing around on my digital piano, cooking, reading blogs, drinking coffee. </p>
<p>Learning new things fuels my soul and allows me to see the bigger picture and to draw connections between seemingly unrelated concepts. My thirst for knowledge knows no bounds - from natural sciences to the arts and humanities, from philosophy to botany, collecting nuggets of knowledge can be incredibly exciting.</p>

<h3>üå± why veganism?</h3>
<p>I consider myself a huge lover of animals, although it still surprises me how I'd lived 20 odd years without questioning the idea of eating the flesh of the very animals I claimed to love. In September 2019, I converted to veganism overnight after watching Earthlings, a documentary which exposes the horrors of the meat, dairy and egg industries. It was a much-needed awakening to the reality that I was directly sentencing innocent sentient beings to their deaths simply by being an ignorant consumer. (I am by no means implying that all meat eaters are ignorant; rather, I am disappointed in how oblivious I was to the extent of suffering I was causing through the seemingly innocuous act of buying and consuming meat.) In addition, learning about the negative environmental impacts resulting from livestock agriculture further reinforced my belief in veganism.</p>
<p>After going vegan, it felt as though a heavy load was lifted off my shoulders. My subconscious probably had an inkling that something was amiss all along, and making the switch helped sort out the inconsistencies I didn't know I had regarding my views on animals and food. More importantly, it has taught me to live more consciously; to be more in tune with my own emotions, more aware of the repercussions of my actions, and more proactive in steering my life towards a more meaningful existence.</p>
<p>To me, choosing not to partake in the exploitation of animals and the destruction of the environment is a commitment to show love and kindness towards animals, the planet, and myself.</p>

<p>If you've made it all the way down, I must say I'm very touched. Thank you for sharing the past few minutes of your time with me, and I'd love to hear from you too.</p>
