Thanks for visiting my little corner of the internet!

<h3>üíª about this site</h3>
This is a space where I document my messy attempts to juggle my many interests and hobbies. It also doubles as a form of accountability to stop myself from slipping back into couch potato mode. A tiny disclaimer: it may sometimes get too personal for comfort. But alas, that's what personal sites are for. :-)
<br><br>
The contents of this site will probably revolve mainly around web design/development, art & illustration, and language learning, which are three areas I'm actively working on right now.
<br><br>
You can reach me at <a href="mailto:notastingray@gmail.com">notastingray@gmail.com</a>. Share a joke, tell me your life story, propose collaboration ideas, or just say hi!

<h3>üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è about me</h3>
Hi! I'm xuan.
<br>
I'm an aspiring creator, a hopeful dreamer, and a curious hermit. Also a fresh computer science graduate who has come to realise that her passion lies in the arts. Currently, I'm self-learning front-end web development and art, while reserving time each day to enjoy my hobbies and favourite pastimes.

<summary>Read on?</summary>
Alrighty, here comes the touchy-feely stuff. ;-)
<br><br>
While the main role of this site is a log to track my progress in the aforementioned areas, it also acts as a journal that I carry with me on my journey of exploration and discovery - both of the extraordinary planet that we inhabit, and of the mystical inner world, of my beliefs and values that shape me and steer me towards the direction of a fulfilling life.
<br>
We're all living on borrowed time. I hope that documenting my works, thoughts & musings will serve as a constant reminder to myself to always strive for growth, to live consciously, and to never forget the magic of life.

<h3>üíñ my values</h3>

I keep and regularly revise a short list of around 10 values that resonate most strongly with me, and I strive to make decisions in accordance with these values. Here's the list somewhat in order of priority:
<br><br>

<ul>
<li><b>Love</b>: referring to love in a general, all-encompassing sense - love for ourselves and others, for what we do, for the environment and the planet, for all living beings, for life itself.</li>
<li><b>Kindness</b>: to treat others and ourselves with care and compassion.</li>
<li><b>Authenticity</b>: to live in congruence with my values and beliefs.</li>
<li><b>Curiosity</b>: to be curious about the world around me, how things work, why things are the way they are. To never stop questioning.</li>
<li><b>Creativity</b>: to imagine, ideate, and make things that reflect our wonderful idiosyncrasies.</li>
<li><b>Freedom</b>: to have the ability to pursue what I want in life.</li>
<li><b>Consistency</b>: to have the discipline to maintain a happy and productive state over the long term.</li>
<li><b>Courage</b>: to be brave in the face of fear.</li>
<li><b>Peace</b>: to maintain inner calm in the midst of chaos.</li>
<li><b>Health</b>: to appreciate my physical and mental wellbeing and to celebrate what my body and mind can accomplish.</li>
</ul>

<h3>üí° interests</h3>
<p>I have a broad range of interests, but I am most passionate when creating things (art, writing, programming, the list goes on...) and learning languages. Other activities I enjoy on my free time include: reading, listening to music, singing, watching the neighbourhood birds do their thing, messing around on my digital piano and guitar, cooking(?), reading blogs, collecting random nuggets of knowledge, drinking coffee, and an occasional LoL game. </p>

<h3>üå± why veganism?</h3>
<p>One fateful night in September 2019, I casually decided to watch a documentary, Earthlings, that exposes the horrors of the meat, dairy and egg industries. Ever since the end of that video, I've never consumed a single shred of animal flesh, and have boycotted all forms of animal products. </p>
<p>Somehow, I had grown so accustomed to seeing meat as food instead of dead animals that it had never occurred to me in 20-odd years that I had been directly sentencing animals to their deaths for the sake of momentary gustatory pleasure. Which usually doesn't even last for half an hour. I had the audacity to call myself an animal lover while indulging in their marinated body parts everyday without batting an eyelid. Needless to say, the documentary induced a massive cognitive dissonance in me and I knew that I wouldn't be able to live with myself without reconsidering my eating and consumption habits.
</p>
<p>While my reason for converting to a vegan lifestyle is primarily an ethical one, there are many other benefits to be reaped, such as increased energy levels and heightened mental clarity (I probably sound like a snake oil seller but I encourage you to try a 7-day experiment if you think it sounds too good to be true. Let me know when that happens!). More importantly, the switch has unlocked a new level of consciousness within me - I'm more in tune with my emotions, more aware of the repercussions of my actions, and more proactive in making my temporary existence a more meaningful one.
</p>
<p>TL;DR: I'm vegan for the animals, the planet, and myself.
