<h2>üíª where am i?</h2>
<p>You are visiting my little corner of the internet and thanks for dropping by. This is a space where I document my messy attempts to juggle my many interests and hobbies. It also doubles as a form of accountability to stop myself from slipping back into couch potato mode. A tiny disclaimer: it may sometimes get too personal for comfort. But alas, that's what personal sites are for. :-)
</p>
<br>
<p>
The contents of this site will probably revolve mainly around my self-study adventures in three areas: web design/development, art & illustration, and language learning.

<h2>üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è who are you?</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm xuan.
<br>
An aspiring creator, a hopeful dreamer, and a curious hermit. I am on a journey of exploration and discovery, both of the beautiful, magical, extraordinary world we inhabit, and of the core values and beliefs that guide me in the direction towards becoming a kinder, better, and more conscious human being.

<h3>üí° interests</h3>
<p>Besides making things, other activities I enjoy on my free time include: reading, listening to music, singing, watching the neighbourhood birds do their thing, messing around on my digital piano and guitar, cooking(?), reading blogs, collecting random nuggets of knowledge, drinking coffee, and an occasional LoL game. </p>

<h3>üå± why veganism?</h3>
<p>One fateful night in September 2019, I casually decided to watch a documentary (Earthlings) about the horrors of the meat, dairy and egg industries. Ever since the end of that video, I've never consumed a single shred of animal flesh, and have boycotted all forms of animal products. </p>
<br>
<p>Somehow, I had grown so accustomed to seeing meat as food instead of dead animals that it had never occurred to me in 20-odd years that I had been directly sentencing innocent creatures to their deaths for the sake of momentary gustatory pleasure. Which usually doesn't even last for more than half an hour. I had the audacity to call myself an animal lover while indulging in their marinated body parts everyday without batting an eyelid. Needless to say, the documentary induced a massive cognitive dissonance in me and I knew that I wouldn't be able to live with myself without reconsidering my eating and consumption habits.
</p>
<br>
<p>While I converted to a vegan lifestyle for primarily ethical reasons, I've come to reap benefits in other aspects of my life as well, such as increased energy levels and mental clarity (I'm not a snake oil seller I swear; I encourage you to try conducting a 7-day experiment if you think it sounds too good to be true. Let me know when that happens!). Not to mention the tremendous environmental benefits that accompany a vegan diet. More importantly, the switch has unlocked a new level of consciousness within me - I'm more in tune with my emotions, more aware of the repercussions of my actions, and more proactive in making my temporary existence a more meaningful one.

If you've made it all the way down, I'm super touched. Thanks for sharing precious minutes of your life with me and I'd love to hear your stories too.
